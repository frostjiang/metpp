MetPP
=====

This repo is used for developing a computational platform for analysis of metabolomics data acquired on a GCÃ—GC-TOF MS system in Scala.

MetPP can process peak merging and filtering, retention index matching, peak list alignment, normalization, statistical significance tests, and pattern recognition, using the peak lists generated by commercial software (ChromaTOF) as its input. 

The performance of MetPP software was tested with sets of experimental data acquired in spike-in experiments and biomarker discovery experiments, respectively. 

Previous package is developed in Matlab, which can be found at http://metaopen.sourceforge.net/metpp.html
